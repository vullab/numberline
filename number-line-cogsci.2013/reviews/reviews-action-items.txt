	Maybe, but it still has to be correlated over timeâ€¦ in this drifty way.

4) why is it not evidence for variation in the (internal,
   pre-verbal-estimate) perception of magnitude itself?  Could be...

Minor points
i) In the introduction, the authors cite several papers in support of
   their argument that in fact measure the mapping from symbolic numbers
   onto a continuous magnitude space (visuo-spatial number line). This
   reverses the direction the authors are interested in; because it is
   unclear whether the mapping function is bidirectionally symmetrical, the
   authors might use such citations with greater caution.
