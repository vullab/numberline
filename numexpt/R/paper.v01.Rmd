How do we estimate numbers?

Conclusions:
- Mapping is bilinear
- Mapping is variable
- Variability for large number guesses arises from this variability
- Autocorrelation of errors show that mapping drifts slowly
- Averaging of previous guess does not capture this behavior


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
